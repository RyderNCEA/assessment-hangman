Hangman:
In Hangman a player tries to guess the word by asking what letters it contains. However, every wrong guess brings them one step closer to losing.

User Mechanics
- User will be asked if they have played before (if no display how to play)
- User will be asked how many rounds they want to play
- User will have to guess letters of the word presented (if correct, letter is added and else if incorrect user is told)
- User must guess these letters before the hangman is finished

Game Mechanics
- Statement Generator that supports multiple lines to create titles and neat messages
- Input checks for any user inputs
- End the game when the amount of rounds left reaches 0
- Store score and letters guessed in an array
- Select random word from large list
- On user guess determine if letter guessed is in the word (if yes show the hidden letter else user moves closer to losing)
- Draw hangman text graphic and change stored text graphic if user guesses wrong.
